This is my submission for the Coursera assignment, for the Reproducible Research course.

    The R Markdown document, containing the R code and written explanations, can be found in the file PA1_template.Rmd. The same document, in Markdown format, can be found at PA1_template.md, and the HTML version at PA1_template.html.
    The “figure” folder contains all of the graphs created in the markdown document.
    The dataset used within the assignment has the file name “repdata_data_activity.zip”.

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:
